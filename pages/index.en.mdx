## What is ESD?

Empty Set Dollar is a fully decentralized, algorithmically self-stabilizing digital dollar. The protocol is centred around an [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) token: [ESD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/empty-set-dollar). This token acts both as the stabilized dollar and as the governance token for the protocol. 

In order to self-stabilize, the protocol uses voluntary supply expansions and contractions around a Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle from the incentivized trading pool on Uniswap.

## Features

ESD has composed a number of different mechanics from various projects into a single protocol. This combination gives it unique features.

- **Decentralised** - Only upgradable via on-chain token governance 
- **Self-Stabilising** - Uses an on-chain price oracle
- **Single Token** - The token is both a stablecoin and a governance token
- **Opt-in Supply Adjustments** - All supply expansions & contractions are incentivised & voluntary
